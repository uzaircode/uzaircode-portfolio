              Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr
              themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and
              web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege
              of building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a
              student-led design studio, and a huge corporation.

              My main focus these days is building products and leading projects
              for our clients at Upstatement. In my free time I've also released
              an online video course that covers everything you need to know to
              build a web app with the Spotify API.
